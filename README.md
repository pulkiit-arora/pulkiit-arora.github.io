- `styles.css` — light-blue theme, responsive layout
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle and small enhancements

Included resume and profile
- `Resume (1) (1).pdf` — a PDF copy of the resume is included and embedded on the site in the "Resume" section. The site content (name, profile summary, experience, skills, projects, and contact information) has been updated to reflect Pulkit Arora's professional details.

How to view
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
- On Windows PowerShell you can run:

- Optional: add case-study pages and wire them into Project cards, or connect a server endpoint for the contact form.
